# Theory of Languages and Automata Project
#### The project of this course had 2 phases.
### Phase 1
* Accepting or rejecting a string with Finite Automata
* Converting NFA to DFA
* Minimizing DFA


### Phase 2
* Accepting or rejecting a string based on the input grammar
* PDA calculator
  * This calculator gets a math expression and calculates it.
* Turing machine
  * Gets a string of an encoded Turing machine, then decodes it and checks some input strings on this machine.
